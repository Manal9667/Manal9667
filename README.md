# Hi, I'm Manal👋

**Data Science | Software Engineering | Quantitative Finance**

*Open to a Summer 2026 Internship!*

I'm a first-year University of Waterloo student pursuing a double major in **Computer Science and Finance**. I specialize in building **data-driven financial solutions** that combine quantitative modeling, software engineering, and real-world problem-solving—from portfolio optimization to inventory risk management.

### 📈 Risk-Averse Portfolio Robo-Advisor
*Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, yfinance*

**🏆 2nd Place** in UW CFM 101 Robo-Advisor Competition

Built a market-neutral portfolio optimizer designed to achieve returns closest to zero during a 5-day live trading period.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented Markowitz minimum-variance optimization using SLSQP solver
- Filtered random TSX/S&P 500 securities by volatility, correlation, and beta
- Applied sophisticated constraints: sector caps (≤40%), position limits (0.5–15%), market cap requirements, transaction cost modeling
- Constructed defensive portfolio with **beta of 0.32** and **10.8% annualized volatility**
- Validated strategy with 1-year historical backtest on $1M CAD across multiple sectors

**Outcome:** Demonstrated strong understanding of portfolio theory and risk management in a competitive, real-money simulation environment.

### 📊 Inventory Risk Management System
*Python, SQL, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib*

Tackled a real-world critical overstock crisis by developing a Monte Carlo-based inventory risk management system.

**Key Achievements:**
- Engineered probabilistic demand forecasting system using Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations per SKU) and negative binomial distributions to quantify uncertainty across 44-product portfolio
- Calculated VaR and CVaR metrics, quantifying **$1,635 expected portfolio profit**
- Generated time-sensitive recommendations for 20 critical SKUs (1,447 units total)
- Identified **7 products facing 100% stockout within 14 days** and flagged 3 negative-margin items for immediate liquidation
- Built risk segmentation model classifying 24 high-risk products
- Currently developing React-based visualization dashboard for stakeholder reporting

**Outcome:** Delivered actionable inventory strategy that balanced stockout risk against holding costs, demonstrating advanced capability in stochastic modeling, financial risk quantification, and data-driven decision-making under uncertainty in a real-world supply chain context.

### 📚 Library Reading Tracker
*React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Open Library API*

Built a full-featured reading management application for tracking, rating, and reviewing books with automated metadata retrieval.

**Features:**
- Integrated Open Library REST API for automatic metadata and cover image population
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS supporting real-time filtering across multiple attributes
- Currently developing Node.js backend with MongoDB for user authentication and cross-device synchronization

**Outcome:** Solved a personal pain point while demonstrating full-stack capabilities—from API integration to database design to responsive UI development. Full-stack development, API integration, responsive design, database architecture

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
- I read **120+ books in 2024** through E-libraries that didn't track them — so I built ReadNest to rate, review, and organize my favorites. Now I keep adding features to it to make it even better! 📚
